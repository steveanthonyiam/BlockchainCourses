## Intro

Memory, storage and calldata what it mean and how to use it ?

Hi my name is Steve Anthony, welcome on my new channel Proof of dev. 

Roll the intro.

## Constant or immutable

Let's take a look a the documentation :

> Storage is the easiest to grasp â€” it is where all state variables are stored. Because state can be altered in a contract (for example, within a function), storage variables must be mutable. However, their location is persistent, and they are stored on the blockchain.
> source : https://medium.com/coinmonks/solidity-storage-vs-memory-vs-calldata-8c7e8c38bce

So if you want to read or write a variable outside of your function, in the state of the Contract, you will use a storage.
